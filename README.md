# Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to make it easy for students to layout their notes efficiently. Learning the new languages of web development - html, css and javascript as well as how to use Git can be very confusing to newbies. This Pre-work Study Guide Webpage solves the problem of note taking and organisation by creating a central location to store notes from the prework. From this project I learned a range of skills in HTML, connecting CSS stylesheets and JavaScript for loops, functions and conditional statements.
